INTERFACE (FULL ABSTRACTION)
---------------------------------
-An interface is a return-type defines the behaviour of a class
-An interface is a buleprint of a class
-It is used to achived abstraction, polymorphism and multiple inheritance
-Interface specific what a class must do and not now.
-It has static constants and abstract method.
-There can be only abstract method in java interface not method body.
-the body is implemented by  the implemented class.
-To implement an interface " implements" keyword is used.
-Class can implement an interface using the "implement" keyword
-Interface also represents the IS-a relationship
-Interface cannot be instatiated (Objects cannot create for an interface)

HOW TO DACLARE AN INTERFACE?
-------------------------------
-Declare using "interface" keyword
-Should not use the keyword "class"
-Interface fields are variable data member public
-Static and final by default.

ENCAPSULATION 
--------------
-Encapsultion is a process of hiding the data and Allowing only thurough methods.
-This hepls to protect the Object data pronotors clear interface for using the object.

DATA HIDING:
--------------
-The internal repersentation(dat or valriable) of an object this hidden from the outside.
-This is typically done by declaretion variable as private.

ACCESS THORUGH METHOD:
----------------------
-Commonly know as GETTER/SETTER methods.
-getter -retrive the value of a private variable.
-Setter -set and update the value of private.

 program:
 class student {
    private int age;  //assign a private keywords because data hiding
    private String name;
    public void setanmeage(String name.int age){ //set the value for variable
            this.name=name;
            this.age=age;
    }
    public void getnameage(){
        system.out.println(name);
        system.out.println(age);
    }
 }
class main{
    p.s.v.m(){
        student s=new student();
        s.setnameage("vijay",20);
        s.getnameage(); //output is vijay 20
    }
}
