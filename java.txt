WHAT IS JAVA ?
----------------
-java is a general purpose programming language
-That is class based and object oriented.
-Developer can write code anywhere and run it without worring about under lying computer.
-It is also refer to has write once run any where(WORA).

HISTORY OF JAVA
----------------
-Java was developed by sun micro systems in year 1995.
-JAMES GOSLING is father of java.
-Before java name is OAK.

INTERFACE (FULL ABSTRACTION)
---------------------------------
-An interface is a return-type defines the behaviour of a class
-An interface is a buleprint of a class
-It is used to achived abstraction, polymorphism and multiple inheritance
-Interface specific what a class must do and not now.
-It has static constants and abstract method.
-There can be only abstract method in java interface not method body.
-the body is implemented by  the implemented class.
-To implement an interface " implements" keyword is used.
-Class can implement an interface using the "implement" keyword
-Interface also represents the IS-a relationship
-Interface cannot be instatiated (Objects cannot create for an interface)

HOW TO DACLARE AN INTERFACE?
-------------------------------
-Declare using "interface" keyword
-Should not use the keyword "class"
-Interface fields are variable data member public
-Static and final by default.

ENCAPSULATION 
--------------
-Encapsultion is a process of hiding the data and Allowing only thurough methods.
-This hepls to protect the Object data pronotors clear interface for using the object.

DATA HIDING:
--------------
-The internal repersentation(dat or valriable) of an object this hidden from the outside.
-This is typically done by declaretion variable as private.

ACCESS THORUGH METHOD:
----------------------
-Commonly know as GETTER/SETTER methods.
-getter -retrive the value of a private variable.
-Setter -set and update the value of private.

 program:
 class student {
    private int age;  //assign a private keywords because data hiding
    private String name;
    public void setanmeage(String name.int age){ //set the value for variable
            this.name=name;
            this.age=age;
    }
    public void getnameage(){
        system.out.println(name);
        system.out.println(age);
    }
 }
class main{
    p.s.v.m(){
        student s=new student();
        s.setnameage("vijay",20);
        s.getnameage(); //output is vijay 20
    }
}


EXCEPTION
----------

-Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that occurs during program excution.
-Distrupting the normal flow of the program's instruction.

 TYPE OF EXPECTION
 -----------------

 -User-defined exception
 -Built-in exception

 BUILT-IN 
 ---------
 -checked Exception
 -unchecked Exception

checked Exception(compile-timr Exception):
-------------------------------------------
 -Checked Exception are called compile-time Exception.
 -These Exception are checkedar compile time by the compiler.
-Must be handled using try-catch block (or) it Should Declarethe
 Exception using throws keyword otherwise the program wil a compilation error
 EX:
    -ClassNotfound Exception
    -Interrupted Exception
    -IO Exception
    -instatiation Exception
    -SQL Exception
    -FileNotFound Exception

unchecked Exception(run-time exception):
-----------------------------------------
-These exception are just opposite to the checked exception
-the compiler will not checked These exception at compile time.
-Most of the times These exception occurs due to the bad data provided by the 
during the user program interacion.
-All unchecked exception are direct subclass of runtime exception class.
EX:
    -Arithmetic exception
    -ClassCast exception
    -NullPointer exception
    -ArrayIndexNotFound exception
    -ArrayStore exception
    -IllegalThreadState exception

EXCEPTION HANDLING:
-------------------
-Exception handling is a machanism in java used to handle euntimr errors.
-It ensures the normal flow of the program is maintained.
-Java provides a structured way to detect and recover from errors.
-It hepls maintain the noemal flow of the execution even when an error occurs.

EXCEPTION HANDLING in java can be achived using:
-------------------------------------------------
    -try
    -catch
    -throw
    -throws
    -finally
